# Gentle Agents activity schema (`gentle-agents.activity/v1`)

An interactive RPC host — a client that runs `pi --mode rpc` itself, such as the Gentle Shell desktop app — receives live Gentle Agents subagent state as one bounded JSON document per coalescing window, so it can render a per-chat Helpers view without polling `subagent_status`.

Source map: [publisher](../lib/agents-rpc-publisher.ts), [wiring](../extensions/gentle-agents.ts), [store](../lib/agents-protocol.ts).

## Turning it on

Set `GENTLE_SHELL_INTERACTIVE_HOST=1` on the `pi --mode rpc` process the host spawns directly. `lib/rpc-host.ts`'s `isInteractiveRpcHost(mode, env)` gates the feature on that exact value; any other value, or its absence, keeps RPC headless — the existing subagent-child behavior is byte-identical. `lib/agents-runner.ts` strips the variable from every subagent child's environment, so a subagent spawned by an interactive host never inherits it and stays headless itself.

## Transport

Pi's `setWidget` is the only fire-and-forget RPC push structured enough to carry this: in RPC mode it accepts a `string[]` (sent as `extension_ui_request`) and silently ignores a component-factory function (the shape the TUI card above the editor uses). The publisher and the TUI card therefore share one widget key without colliding on the wire — a plain RPC host or a TUI session only ever sees the factory call, which its own transport ignores or renders locally.

```json
{
  "type": "extension_ui_request",
  "method": "setWidget",
  "widgetKey": "gentle-agents",
  "widgetLines": ["{\"schema\":\"gentle-agents.activity/v1\", ...}"]
}
```

`widgetLines` is always exactly one line: one JSON document, `JSON.stringify`'d, never pretty-printed. Parse it as `gentle-agents.activity/v1`.

## Payload shape

```jsonc
{
  "schema": "gentle-agents.activity/v1",
  "summary": { "running": 1, "queued": 0, "waiting": 0, "finished": 2 },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "summary": {
        "id": "t_abc123",
        "agent": "explore",
        "mode": "task",
        "model": "claude-bridge/claude-sonnet-5-5",
        "thinking": "medium",
        "label": "Map the auth module",
        "prompt": "Explore how authentication works…",
        "status": "running",
        "createdAt": 1732000000000,
        "startedAt": 1732000000100,
        "endedAt": null,
        "lastStep": "reading lib/auth.ts",
        "lastActivityAt": 1732000005000,
        "turns": 2,
        "toolCalls": 3,
        "error": null
      },
      "thread": {
        "version": 7,
        "dropped": 0,
        "total": 2,
        "items": [
          { "kind": "text", "text": "Looking at the auth flow first." },
          { "kind": "tool", "name": "read", "args": "{\"path\":\"lib/auth.ts\"}", "running": false, "isError": false, "output": "…file contents…" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`summary` is `TaskSummary` from `lib/agents-protocol.ts`, unchanged. Each task's `summary` is a field whitelist of its `TaskRecord`: `id`, `agent`, `mode`, `model`, `thinking` (`null` when unset), `label`, `prompt`, `status`, `createdAt`, `startedAt`, `endedAt`, `lastStep`, `lastActivityAt`, `turns`, `toolCalls`, `error`. Every other `TaskRecord` field — `cwd`, `parentSessionId`, `sessionPath`, `result`, `tokens`, `cost` — is deliberately left out, the same discipline `lib/orchestrator-presence.ts`'s `projectActivity` already applies to same-profile peer discovery.

`thread.items` is a `ThreadItem[]` whitelist too: text/thinking/note items keep `{ kind, text }` (`text` bounded, see below); tool items carry `{ kind: "tool", name, args, running, isError, output }`, where `args` is the tool's argument object `JSON.stringify`'d (never the raw object). `thread.dropped` is the store's own ring-buffer drop counter (unrelated to the per-push item cap below); `thread.version` increments on every thread mutation. `thread.total` counts every item the task ever had; since every bound below keeps the newest items, `items[i]` is item number `total - items.length + i`, which lets a host place items that stream in place.

Tasks are ordered `running`, `waiting`, `queued`, then finished tasks by `endedAt` descending (most recently finished first).

## Bounds

Every bound below fails closed: a value that cannot fit is truncated or dropped, and `lib/agents-rpc-publisher.ts`'s `encodeActivityLines` never throws.

| Field | Bound |
|---|---|
| `summary.prompt` | 200 characters, trailing `…` |
| `summary.error`, `summary.label`, `summary.lastStep` | 500 characters, trailing `…` |
| tool `args` (stringified) | 500 characters, trailing `…` |
| tool `output` | 500 characters, trailing `…` |
| text/thinking/note item `text` | 2000 characters, trailing `…` |
| `thread.items` per task | last 40, most recent last |
| whole payload | 256 KiB |

Truncation always keeps the field's prefix and marks the cut with a trailing `…` (never a separate `truncated` flag) — the same convention `projectRpcActivity`'s other bounded fields already use.

When the whole-payload bound is still exceeded after the field- and item-level truncations above, `encodeActivityLines` shrinks the payload in this order:

1. Halve every task's kept `thread.items` (repeatedly, down to one item each).
2. Empty finished tasks' threads entirely.
3. Drop whole finished tasks — oldest-finished first, by `endedAt`.
4. Last resort: once only active (running/waiting/queued) tasks remain, each already down to one thread item, empty every remaining task's thread too — a summary-only payload.

An active task's `summary` (running, waiting or queued) is never dropped; only its `thread.items` shrink. Finished tasks can be dropped whole by step 3, oldest first.

## Generation and watchdog progress

While an active assistant message streams a tool-call block, validated fresh,
nonempty argument deltas renew the runner's idle watchdog independently of
thread/display events. `summary.lastStep` becomes `generating tool arguments`
and `lastActivityAt` advances; no partial argument data is stored in the thread,
diagnostic, or progress tracker. `toolCalls` increments only at execution start.
Token/cost totals still update only from finalized assistant `message_end` usage,
not streaming usage; static totals do not establish inactivity.

The tracker admits blocks announced by current RPC identity fields or older Pi
partial snapshots. It rejects empty/malformed deltas, unannounced or closed
blocks, stale message starts, and duplicate argument fingerprints. RPC provides
no delta sequence number, so identical chunks within one block are conservatively
indistinguishable from replay and do not renew liveness. Only hashes are retained,
with a 4096-fingerprint bound per assistant message; exhaustion fails closed until
a newer message starts. Unrelated UI and unrecognized event traffic do not renew
argument liveness. Existing RPC command-response handling is unchanged.

Idle and in-flight execution watchdog budgets are **renewable silence bounds**,
not absolute run/generation duration limits. Argument generation uses the idle
budget, not the longer announced-execution budget. Later silence still times out;
execution start/end and cancellation retain their existing behavior.

## Coalescing

`createRpcActivityPublisher` subscribes to `TaskStore#subscribeSummary` (task added, removed, or changed status) and to `TaskStore#subscribe(id)` for every known task, including ones added after `start()`. Changes inside a 150 ms window collapse into exactly one `setWidget("gentle-agents", [line])` call; `stop()` tears down every subscription and publishes one final frame.
